# LoL-TensorFlow-Projects
Repo that contains all models I built using TensorFlow to model League of Legends data sets. This includes LoLWinPredictor - my model which aims to predict whether a team would win or lose depending on their champion bans!

Here are some ideas I've penned down for current and future models.

## Ideas

* Computer Vision: Accurately identify LoL character splash arts?

* Time Series/Forecasting: Predict botlane winrate after first tower taken? 

* How big of an effect bans of a specific champion have? 

* Predict winrate based on enemy champion bans?

Data Sets used: games.csv (Kaggle), League of Legends Ranked Games (Kaggle:https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/datasnaek/league-of-legends?select=champion_info_2.json)
